## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Database?

### Definition:

A database is a structured collection of data that is stored electronically and managed by a Database Management System (DBMS). It enables efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data.

### Characteristics:

* **Structured:** Data is organized into tables, records, fields.
* **Persistent:** Data remains available over time.
* **Accessible:** Can be queried using specialized languages (e.g., SQL).
* **Secure:** Allows authorization and access control.
* **Concurrent Access:** Supports multiple users simultaneously.
* **Integrity Constraints:** Enforces rules to maintain data accuracy.

### Traditional File System vs Database:

| Feature            | File System | Database              |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Redundancy Control | No          | Yes                   |
| Data Integrity     | Manual      | Enforced by DBMS      |
| Querying Ability   | Limited     | Rich querying via SQL |
| Concurrency        | Poor        | Excellent             |
| Scalability        | Low         | High                  |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Importance of Databases

* **Efficiency:** Speeds up data access through indexing, query optimization.
* **Integrity:** Maintains consistency through constraints and transactions.
* **Security:** Manages access with user roles and permissions.
* **Backup and Recovery:** Protects data through automated processes.
* **Scalability:** Designed to grow with the application.
* **Analytics:** Powers reporting, BI tools, and decision-making systems.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Terminology

| Term           | Description                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DBMS           | Software to create, manage, and interact with a database            |
| Table          | Organized data structure using rows and columns                     |
| Row (Record)   | A single data entry or instance in a table                          |
| Column (Field) | A specific attribute or property of the data                        |
| Query          | A command to retrieve or manipulate data                            |
| Schema         | Blueprint or design of the database (tables, fields, relationships) |
| Primary Key    | Uniquely identifies each record in a table                          |
| Foreign Key    | Links records across tables through relationships                   |
| Index          | Data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval            |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Data Model?

### Definition:

A data model is a conceptual model that defines how data is stored, related, and accessed within a database. It provides a structured framework that enables consistent data management and design.

### Benefits:

* Clear structure
* Easy maintenance
* Logical data access
* Better collaboration between developers and DBAs

### Key Concepts:

* **Entities:** Real-world objects (e.g., Student, Course)
* **Attributes:** Properties of entities (e.g., Student Name, ID)
* **Relationships:** Associations between entities (e.g., Enrolled In)

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Data Models

### 1. Hierarchical Model

* Organizes data in a tree-like structure (parent-child)
* Each child has one parent
* Example: Organizational chart
* Limitation: Poor flexibility

### 2. Network Model

* Graph structure with multiple relationships
* Each child can have multiple parents
* Used in early DBMS systems like IDS, IDMS

### 3. Relational Model

* Uses tables (relations)
* Based on mathematical relations
* Most widely used
* Supports SQL

### 4. Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

* Used for designing databases visually
* Entities, attributes, and relationships
* Converted into relational schema during implementation

### 5. Object-Oriented Model

* Based on objects (from OOP)
* Data stored as classes and objects
* Ideal for multimedia and complex data

### 6. Document Model (NoSQL)

* Uses documents (typically JSON/XML)
* Schema-less
* Ideal for fast development and changing requirements

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Databases

### Relational Databases (SQL)

* Structured data in rows and columns
* Schema defined in advance
* Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)
* Supports ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
* Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

### NoSQL Databases

* Designed for semi-structured or unstructured data
* Scales horizontally
* Types:

#### a. Document-Oriented

* Stores data in JSON-like format
* Flexible schema
* Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB

#### b. Key-Value Stores

* Simplest NoSQL model
* Each item stored as a key-value pair
* Examples: Redis, DynamoDB

#### c. Column-Family Stores

* Stores data in columns, optimized for reads/writes
* Examples: Cassandra, HBase

#### d. Graph Databases

* Represents data as nodes and relationships
* Ideal for social networks, fraud detection
* Examples: Neo4j, ArangoDB

#### e. Time-Series Databases

* Optimized for time-stamped or chronological data
* Examples: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB

#### f. NewSQL

* Modern relational databases with NoSQL scalability
* Examples: Google Cloud Spanner, CockroachDB
